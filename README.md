# Transformer-Based-Deep-Learning-Models-for-Sarcasm-Detection-with-an-Imbalanced-Dataset.
TrainEnglish.csv dataset is from the Semval2022 subtask A of task 6, which is classifying whether a tweet is sarcastic or nonsarcastic.

TestEnglish.csv dataset is from the Semval2022 subtask A of task 6.

The train.csv dataset represents the .85 of the TrainEnglish.csv and the valid.csv represents the .15 of the TrainEnglish.csv (Imbalanced).

trainBal.csv and validBal.csv represent the balanced (downsampled) train and validation versions of the TrainEnglish.csv.

trainAug.csv and validAug.csv represent the augmented train and validation versions of the TrainEnglish.csv.

Ensem.ipynb represents the ensemble method code. to run it 

sequentialModels.ipynb represnet the code used  to train the RNN-based models on the Imbalanced datasets of the train and validation // When running it, pay attention to the location paths of datasets files.
